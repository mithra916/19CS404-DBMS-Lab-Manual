# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
Question 1 :
---
Write a SQL statement to Update the reorder level to 20 where the quantity in stock is less than 10 and product category is 'Snacks' in the products table.
```
Products table

product_id
product_name
category
cost_price
sell_price
reorder_lvl
quantity
supplier_id
```
## SQL Code:
```
update products
set reorder_lvl=20
where (quantity <10) and 
category='Snacks';
```

Question 3 :
---
Increase the reorder level by 30% for products from 'Food' category having quantity in stock less than 50% of existing reorder level in the products table
```

supplier_id           INT
```
## SQL Code:
```
update products
set reorder_lvl=cast(reorder_lvl *1.3 as integer)
where category='Food' and quantity<(reorder_lvl*0.5);
